    <h1>Deployment successful ðŸ™Œ</h1>
    <p>
      Congratulations! If you see this page, you have successfully deployed your
      Keystone Blog Enrichment App.  
    </p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">What now?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Login to the <a href="/admin">Admin UI</a>.</li>

      <li>
        Connect Keystone to your blog or website. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We created an initial user: <code>admin@keystonejs.com</code> with a password: <code>keystoneuser</code> (or whatever you set during deployment). You should update these once you login.</p>
    <p>We've also created a template for you using one of our favourite static site generators <a href="https://www.11ty.io">Eleventy</a>. It's configured to display comments, reading list, claps and other dynamic features that you can manage in Keystone. Here's what you need to do to set it up:</p>
    <h3 class="sub-heading">1. Copy your Keystone API URL</h3>

    <div class="copy">
      <div class="copy-url js-copy-url">loading...</div>
      <button class="copy-button js-copy-button">Copy</button>
    </div>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">2. Deploy the front-end to Netlify</h3>
    <p>
      Deploy the front-end in one click with this conveninent purple button.
    </p>

    <a
      class="deploy-netlify"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/MadeByMike/supermaya"
      >Deploy to Netlify</a
    >
    <p>
      You will be asked to provide the Keystone API URL at the start of the Netlify installation.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">3. Clone the repo</h3>
    <p>
      Netlify will create a Github repository for you. You can clone this locally and make changes. Follow the
      instructions in the README file to get started!
